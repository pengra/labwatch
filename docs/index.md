# Migrating lab-watch
// Written on **September 15th, 2018**

Hello users of lab-watch. I thank you for continuing to use Lab-watch despite all its bugs. Unfortunately, as more and more students (and their sessions) are added to the database, the cost of running the app has become unsustainable for a mere college student. In fact, the past few months have been a net-loss. Because of this, I'm making the decision to host the app on my personal server.

## Actions you will need to take
On **Monday, September 24th, 2018** [library.pengra.io](https://library.pengra.io) will open. On **Friday, September 28th, 2018** [lab-watch.herokuapp.com](https://lab-watch.herokuapp.com) will be shut down to prevent next month's bill cycle. Logging in will use the same usernames/passwords.

- **You will also need to set bookmarks of kiosks to the new website. These links will be different.**
- It is recomended you reupload an XML file of all student IDs. Especially Student IDs that begin with a "0".

## Major Changes To Service
The biggest change is downtime: **Servers will be down between 11pm and 5am.** I'm also **switching the pricing to a pay-what-you-think-it's-worth model for the following years**. The suggested donation is <span style="color: #66BB6A">$70/year</span>; but any amount helps! Payment will now be entirely done online using a secure [third party service](https://stripe.com/) (no need to hand us checks anymore!).

## Future Changes to Service
This app will go through a major update which will transform the look of the site. Documentation will be provided. Mechanics of the site will remain the same.

## New Data Policy
This new server is essentially where I apply all my UW math classes for data science purposes. In short, musings about library usage (and how you, the librarians, use the new interface) may be published. Identifiable student/librarian data will never be published, but will be used to improve the service (e.g. what page/functionality is used the most). Additionally, the following services may collect your data:

- [Google Analytics TOS](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html)
- [Stripe TOS](https://stripe.com/us/legal)

## Wait! I found a bug!
