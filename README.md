# LabWatch

The purpose of this project is to help libraries track who is using their resources and for what purpose.
Labwatch hopes to expand beyond that and engage students with librarians in the future.

# JQuery Implementation
This branch introduces JQuery for rendering pages. This makes pages, source code, apps and features more maintainable and reusable. Details on how to build off of this system are included in the source files.
